This module is a collection of custom trappings and features for Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play 4th edition game system for Foundry Virtual Table Top  

Forien's Armoury started as a compendium of my own custom items and houserules and as the time went by, it got expanded


### Notable changes in v3.1.0
* Updated for Active Effects using Data Models (with [Warhammer Library](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/warhammer-lib)) and verified for WFRP4e 8.0.1
* Created `Grimoire` type for Items.
  * This is new item type in the system, which allows to transfer spells from Grimoires without need to add spells themselves to an Actor.
  * It allows GMs to create items that award spells when held (or equipped, configurable) and take the spells away when grimoire is lost (or unequipped)
  * Memorized spells are not removed
  * Additional options to limit spells based on known language, lores, ability to Read/Write etc.
* You can read full changelog [here](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-armoury/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Notable changes in v3.0.0
* Verified for Foundry v12 and set it as minimum version due to lack of backwards compatibility
* Fixed Item Properties, macros and some other issues

### Notable changes in v2.1.0
* Added following GM only Macros:
  * Character Status summary — lets GM generate a quick table showing basic summary of party composition - careers, fate/resilience points, experience
  * Award XP with Companions — allows GM to award party the XP, based on whether Actors are in specified folders. Companions receive half.
* Added following GM & Player Macros:
  * Use Cantrip — allows using "Cants" using rules from `Archives of the Empire Vol.III`. Require duplication and setup
  * Make Extended Lockpick Test — allows both GMs and Players to create Extended Lockpick Tests for their characters to attempt. Configuration available


### Notable changes in v2.0.0
* Updated all of module's Active Effect to work or take advantage of WFRP4e's [Effect Refactor Update](https://github.com/moo-man/WFRP4e-FoundryVTT/releases/tag/7.1.0)
  * Because of that, all Active Effects (such as Runes, some trappings, traits and talents) on existing Actors need to be replaced with new ones from compendium! 
* Created `Magic Scrolls` type for Items
  * This is new item type in the system, which allows casting Spells from Scrolls, without need to add spell itself to an Actor
* Added `Generate Random Scroll` Macro, which improves the WoM macro by creating Magic Scroll Item
* New Weapon Rune
  * Rune of Fracture. Adds Impact, but damages weapon by 2 per attack.
* 15 new Petty Spells of Silliness. They are quite silly!
* Added `Runebound` species with `Reiklander` and `Orphaned` subspecies to Chargen
  * Added Rolltables for Runebound Career and Runebound Random Talents for use during Chargen
* Added `Combat Fatigue – Rounds Before Test` counter to Combat Tracker (thanks to silent_mark)
* Added setting to allow automatic falling unconscious of characters from 0 wounds in CRB ruleset (thanks to silent_mark)
* Added 3 new Diseases and 3 new Symptoms to _„RassilonMonk's Cauldron of Nurgle“_
* Several other changes to both content and codebase, [read more](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-armoury/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Contents
### Features
This Module adds some QoL and automation features, including mechanics that:
* Allow for automatic removal of **Temporary Runes** when they get disabled (preferably by `Times Up` Module). 
  * Optionally allows for damaging an Item when Rune is removed (disabled by default).
* **Magic Scrolls**, completely new, independent Item type that allows characters to cast spells from scrolls without needing to know the Spell
* **Arrow Reclamation**, allowing players to recover some of the ammunition (arrows, bolts or sling bullets) after an encounter. Defaults to even rolls. Disabled by default.
* **Combat Fatigue**, using optional _„Getting Tired“_ ruleset.
* **Casting Fatigue**, providing soft limit to amount of spells that can be cast in short amount of time.
* **Automated Disease Progression**, allowing for `incubation` and `duration` of diseases to countdown automatically.
* Additionally this module contains quite a bit of utility or quality of life macros. You can find full list [down below](#Macros), but here are few:
  * **Generate Random Scroll** (Macro), improved WoM macro that now creates usable Magic Scroll
  * **Check Careers** (Macro), allows players to quickly check their progress through current Career and how far are they from completing it.

## Troubleshooting and Debug
If you want to have deeper understanding of why module behaves the way it does, **you can enable Debug in module's setting**.

This setting makes it so that module will output a ton of information into the console whenever is performs or attempts to perform an action.

You can open the console by using `F12` keybind on most browsers.

**Tip**: Use `Forien's Armoury` as filter in console to only see this module's messages.



## Recommended 3rd Party Modules
These modules are important for functionality of this module's **Features**. While not strictly **required**, I highly recommend using them:
* [Times Up](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/times-up) — Allows for automatic disabling of effects, especially useful for Temporary Runes introduced in Forien's Armoury.
* [Simple Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) — A time tracking module is _**required**_ for **Automatic Disease Progression** as well as **Automated Magical Endurance Regeneration**. Simple Calendar is recommended since it works well with WFRP4e! 

### Other suggested modules
These modules work with _some Documents_ (Actors, Items etc.) I provide in the Compendiums. Those are only necessary if you plan on using those Documents.
* [Active Token Effects](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ATL) — Allows to use presets such as "torch" etc. for Lighting items
* [Item Piles](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles) — Awesome module that allows you to make tokens lootable, create treasure chests, bank vaults and - most importantly in my opinion - merchants. Forien's Armoury includes 92 Rollable Tables ready to be used to Populate Items for Merchants, as well as 6 prefab merchants!

### Notable mentions
* [DFreds Effects Panel](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dfreds-effects-panel) — Isn't specifically linked to Forien's Armoury in any way, but provides nice and clean effects display with ability to toggle them, so I recommend trying it 




## Future plans

### Features
* Easy to use UI for creating runic items

### Content
* New Career Paths
  * [Added in v1.4.0] ~~Monster Hunter – mundane alternative to the Runebound Ranger, trained to specialize in one of several fighting style~~
  * Hunter Engineer – an Engineer that specializes in weapons, traps and gadgets designed to be effective against monsters
  * Balancing tweaks to all careers in Monster Hunter Class, if needed
* More dwarven Runes

*If you have **any** suggestion or idea on new contents, open an [Issue](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-armoury/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) or hit me up on Discord!*


## Known issues

* Sometimes, the **Automated Disease Progression** feature will stop on `duration = 1` and throw an error. This is due to a bug existing in the WFRP4e itself. 
  * **Workaround:** When you see this error, consider disease `finished` and follow-up accordingly. Usually deleting the disease Item from Actor is the right course of action.
